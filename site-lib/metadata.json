The Hall has two open walls, one that connects to the Entrance and another to the Tower. The remaining walls are covered floor-to-ceiling with bookshelves. In the center of the Hall is an information kiosk. The rest of the floor is filled with a variety of chairs, tables, and couches. Even the bookshelves have embedded nooks at different levels with extra sitting space.Books in the Hall include general information such as history textbooks, popular memoirs and fundamental texts. For ease of access, the information kiosk houses ‘search scrolls’ that indexes all the books in the library. However depending on a student’s access, certain books are not available to read or check-out. Excluding the ceiling-high ladders, light sprites can also be used to retrieve books for students.The Tower is divided into four floors. Each floor focuses on a specific field that Esemone is known for. From bottom to top: Abjuration, Conjuration, Necromancy, and Divination. To access any higher floors, a magic user has to activate a levitation circle that’s in the center of each floor. Anyone with library access can visit any floor (minus Necromancy) but won’t be able to read high-level or degree-specific texts.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Esemone","level":1,"id":"Esemone_0"},{"heading":"General Info","level":1,"id":"General_Info_0"},{"heading":"History","level":1,"id":"History_0"},{"heading":"The Enna Library","level":1,"id":"The_Enna_Library_0"},{"heading":"ENTRANCE","level":2,"id":"ENTRANCE_0"},{"heading":"MAIN HALL","level":2,"id":"MAIN_HALL_0"},{"heading":"THE TOWER","level":2,"id":"THE_TOWER_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"2.-world/2.5-education/magical-universities/esemone,-institute-of-the-arcana.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1722452733624,"modifiedTime":1754357984443,"sourceSize":1890,"sourcePath":"2.

Emer is viewed as a gentle and maternal-like figure, although in recent centuries her influence has started to become overshadowed by her fellow gods. Emer is the goddess of soil, creatures and remembrance. Her followers are often found in roles relating to preservation.

The Waterbearer then chose the First Queen of Eora, and the line of succession has run through women ever since. Once the surviving populace was safe within Eora’s walls, the True Gods spent and continued to spend their time battling against the Shadow Flood.

The physical walls between cities are thiner and shorter than the outermost walls. This allows for air and ground travel between cities without seeing anything beyond the kingdom. The outermost walls are about thirteen miles (20.9 km) in height, and the inner cities' walls are about 6 miles (9.65 km) in height.\nThe physical walls seemingly extend infinitely underground, and attempts to find the end in the past has lead to devastating casualties.\nAll air travel has a maximum altitude before simply being unable to work. The maximum altitude is the height of the outermost walls.\nThe magical walls are best seen from the sky. A iridescent shimmer can be seen in certain lighting from above as it makes a seemingly dome shape across the kingdom. Magic users and philosophers have hypothesized that the day and night cycle is simulated by the magical barrier. Records show all types of weather patterns to have occurred in the past, but in recent centuries extreme weather changes have come far and few between. Due to the manner in which the kingdom was formed, there has always been a startling lack of a fertile soil. In the beginning, all fertile soil was blessed by Emer and given to the Royal Family to manage. Only this blessed soil has the capacity to grow life.\nIn modern times, having this soil has been a sign of great wealth or an indication of close ties with the Royal Family. When <a data-href=\"The Garden\" href=\"2.-world/2.3-geography/landmarks/the-garden.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Garden</a> was being constructed, the Family donated blessed soil to the temple. Over the centuries an enormous tree has grown from it, and has become a symbol of a potential future. <br>Other than the blessed soil, water is the second most regulated resource in Eora. Initially it was also given to the Royal Family to manage, but as Eora grew the Family handed the responsibility to the <a data-href=\"Council of Eora#Head Councilman of Water\" href=\"2.-world/2.4-government/2.44-council-of-eora/council-of-eora.html#Head Councilman of Water\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Head Councilman of Water</a> and their respective boards.\n<br>All water is sourced from the Trench. The Trench is a chasm of groundwater the circles around <a data-href=\"Hollyhock\" href=\"2.-world/2.3-geography/cities/hollyhock.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hollyhock</a>.

On this day (that occurs once every eight years), the Trench is opened in a feat of engineering, and the Waterbearer pours rain only into the chasm. Water is mostly used for hydroponic farming. With the list of crops being reduced to only potatoes, wheat and rice overtime. The crops that remain are only potatoes, wheat and rice. Rice is expensive, and is mostly seen in upper-class districts and cities. Wheat and potatoes are more plentiful and cheap, and are a staple in most dishes. Other produce, spices, condiments, etc. are now chemically manufactured.\nMeat and poultry are plentiful and are also a staple in most dishes. Drinkable water is seen as a symbol of wealth, and is expensive to purchase pure. Most people drink milk (or diluted milk), manufactured juices or alcohol. Buildings and structures dating back to the beginning of Eora were made primarily of wood. As the kingdom grew, newer constructions were built from metal and concrete. Similar to drinkable water, having pure wooden fixtures is a sign of wealth and status.
