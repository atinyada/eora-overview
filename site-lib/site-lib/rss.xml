Offers Bachelors of Magic degrees. Gives minors/Masters in Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Necromancy, and Magical Theory. (Can make more.) Has clubs of valor and lore.
WIPEsemone’s library, the Enna, consists of three main sections: the entrance, the main hall, and the tower.The Entrance has a coffee shop on one wall and a visitor kiosk on the opposite wall. The back wall is an open entryway with a magical gate that restricts access to students, faculty, and those given permission.The Main Hall is all one floor and is about one-and-a-half stories all. The Hall has two open walls, one that connects to the Entrance and another to the Tower. The remaining walls are covered floor-to-ceiling with bookshelves. In the center of the Hall is an information kiosk. The rest of the floor is filled with a variety of chairs, tables, and couches. Even the bookshelves have embedded nooks at different levels with extra sitting space.Books in the Hall include general information such as history textbooks, popular memoirs and fundamental texts. For ease of access, the information kiosk houses ‘search scrolls’ that indexes all the books in the library. However depending on a student’s access, certain books are not available to read or check-out. Excluding the ceiling-high ladders, light sprites can also be used to retrieve books for students.The Tower is divided into four floors. Each floor focuses on a specific field that Esemone is known for. From bottom to top: Abjuration, Conjuration, Necromancy, and Divination. To access any higher floors, a magic user has to activate a levitation circle that’s in the center of each floor. Anyone with library access can visit any floor (minus Necromancy) but won’t be able to read high-level or degree-specific texts.]]></description><link>2.-world/2.5-education/magical-universities/esemone,-institute-of-the-arcana.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">2.

after Irosys does some reconnaissance, the party enacts a plan that distracts and obscures the vision of the sky pirates as the party sneaks past them the party fails to sneak past the pirates without being noticed, and Yuan members chase them down a narrow corridor that leads to a chasm with more members
<br>before things could escalate into a full on fight, Disapro talks to one of the higher ranked members until Madam <a data-href="Dolores Lotus" href="3.-npcs/the-yuan/dolores-lotus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dolores Lotus</a> arrives
the Madam and Diaspro have an argument and Diaspro doubles down on the lie as to why she and the rest of party are in the mines
before the Yuan leave, a few things are hinted: in certain circles, there is a bounty out for people like Irosys
they used an alternative means of leaving the mines, probably by air
the Madam's son is the reason why they were there the party then traces back Diaspro's steps towards the end of the puzzle they were originally following <br>in a small cavity to the side, the party meets a white thal miner named <a data-href="Otto" href="3.-npcs/white-thal-miners/otto.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Otto</a>
takeaways from their conversation with Otto: Thia reads his mind and relives a meeting between him, Zeke and a mysterious person during a NDA meeting
<br>the only features Thia can pick out is that the mysterious figure has a black band on their left ring finger, an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Esemone, Institute of the Arcana" data-href="Esemone, Institute of the Arcana" href="2.-world/2.5-education/magical-universities/esemone,-institute-of-the-arcana.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Esemone</a> alumni pin on their expensive-looking shirt, and is holding a red crystal
then the party asks Otto why he is alone, and Otto answers vaguely
Irosys reveals his face and asks Otto earnestly if he's seen his dad, Otto denies ever seeing him
Diaspro then offers Otto 10 gold pieces if he answers honestly, but Otto declines saying "It's not what he needs" and that "It's not enough gold anyway"
Otto, in so many words, hints that one of his own is "in trouble" and needs a high-level mage for something
<br>before the party leaves, Kaimop gives Otto the address to <a data-href="the Last Line Tavern" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/landmarks/the-last-line-tavern.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Last Line Tavern</a> and implores him to meet with them tomorrow to talk more about what he needs the party then retraces their steps until they make their way out of cave 10
<br>minus Diaspro, the party uses potions to either turn invisible or into mist and sneak past the <a data-href="Ivory Guards" href="2.-world/2.4-government/2.45-ivory-guards/ivory-guards.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ivory Guards</a>
Diaspro gets caught by said Ivory Guards, and her forged letter doesn't fool them

in order to sneak past the guards to the mines, the party plans to create a explosion that will distract the guards while they slip their way past the gate
while sneaking around, the party notices the upped security due to the recent theft of white thal
after successfully sneaking around the Ivory Guard patrolling the cave entrance, the party uses the symbol found on Rus' letter to navigate the different pathways
while making their way through the mines, the party - minus Diaspro - sinks into loose gravel and fall 60ft into a large cave hub
Thia is the first to notice a large spider along the roof of the hub
the large spider jumps down despite Thia's attempt to make it fall asleep, and the battle begins

Wood Elves are nobility based strictly on their race. Consists of two lines: Upper Branches and Lower Roots.

Her eyes and outfit defer by the artist, but typically she has either blue or black colored eyes, and wears an extravagant dress in shades of blue. The Waterbearer is often shown holding an urn or large bowl, pouring water into fields or into the Trench. Her immaterial forms include crashing/rushing water and calming/booming rain.The original symbol of the Waterbearer was of a sea shell. In modern times, her worshippers made a water droplet her official symbol. Stories of the Waterbearer write her as a benevolent being with an incredible temperament and pose. She is a being that rules above all others and is something to look up to.The Waterbearer is the deity of water, change and choice. Those that follow her are the cornerstones adapting to and creating change. They embody kindness, calmness, and the willingness to “go with the flow.” Their beliefs revolve around the ability to make their own choices and pave their own destiny.Over six thousand years ago, the Shadow Flood swept across the lands and consumed everything in its path. To protect those remaining, the 3 True Gods created the Kingdom of Eora as a haven. Vulcan the Inventor, created the kingdom's foundations using his omnipotent knowledge of technology. Tempest the Waterbearer, graced the kingdom with water, its primary resource. Emer of the Soil gave the kingdom life giving it a precious amount of soil, crops, and animals.&nbsp;Soon after establishing the Kingdom of Eora, the True Gods hand-picked and blessed a Dark Elven family (the Pacifics) that would become the Royal Family. The Waterbearer then chose the First Queen of Eora, and the line of succession has run through women ever since. Once the surviving populace was safe within Eora’s walls, the True Gods spent and continued to spend their time battling against the Shadow Flood. They do this with the hope that one day the survivors will be able to walk the earth freely once again.

Wavy blond hair and mischievous gray eyes were common features across different illustrations. After the Salvation, his image was aged to be of an older man with graying blond hair and solemn gray eyes. His clothing changes often, and is largely dependent on the current trends. His immaterial forms include the clattering of tools, the hum of running machinery, and the ticking of a clock.The Inventor’s symbol is of a clock, one of humanity’s greatest inventions.Due to the earliest recorded images of him, many believe that the Inventor is the youngest of the True Gods. However, he has aged the most over the centuries, and is seen as a great educator and philosopher.The Inventor is the god of technology, creativity and innovation. His believers can typically be found amongst architects, mechanics and those with a penchant for tinkering. Many renowned inventors attribute some of their greatest inventions to visions from the Inventor. Those that follow him embody the conviction to “try, try, and try again.”Over six thousand years ago, the Shadow Flood swept across the lands and consumed everything in its path.

Her eyes are typically brown or green, but her outfit varies wildly by artist. She’s been depicted wearing farmer clothes, extravagant dresses, and commoner outfits. Her immaterial forms include rumbling earth, crunched leaves, and sounds of nature.Emer’s symbol is of a rose, although any plant imagery can be attributed to her.Historians believe her to be the oldest of the True Gods, and they read about her maturity and wisdom in solving conflicts of long past. Emer is viewed as a gentle and maternal-like figure, although in recent centuries her influence has started to become overshadowed by her fellow gods. Emer is the goddess of soil, creatures and remembrance. Her followers are often found in roles relating to preservation.

the party - minus Diaspro - kill both the large and medium cave spiders. after killing the spiders, the party rushes to pick a burrow opening that could lead out of the den. while looking for a way out, Irosys peaks into a burrow opening and sees an opened spider cocoon
soon after choosing an opening, the medium spider that Thia had put to sleep before the battle wakes up and chases them up a narrow crawlspace that leads out of the den
once the party digs their way out, they travel up one of the mining pathways that hasn't been walked in a long time. they go through a series of tunnels before walking on a path that has lanterns hanging from above
eventually the party hears sounds of metal clinking and clashing, and Irosys scouts ahead to investigate Irosys stumbles upon a scene of 2 opposing sky pirate factions (<a data-href="Aerosol" href="2.-world/2.7-organizations/2.72-unofficial/aerosol.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Aerosol</a> and <a data-href="The Yuan" href="2.-world/2.7-organizations/2.72-unofficial/the-yuan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Yuan</a>) fighting and arguing. before returning to the group, Irosys overhears the <a data-href="The Yuan" href="2.-world/2.7-organizations/2.72-unofficial/the-yuan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Yuan</a> members wanting someone returned to them. after trying to catch anyone from the party as they sink and fall through loose gravel, Diaspro shouts the remaining directions down to them before continuing through the mines
after following the directions, Diaspro makes it to a dead-in as the path ahead looks caved-in. investigating around, Diaspro uncovers a trap door, and uses the rope to travel deeper underground
Diaspro then travels and explores an array of different tunnels before sticking to one that has a metal door in its side. making her way inside, she looks around a locker-room like space before taking a blue-lit lantern, and a black dagger that a skeleton hand was clutching closely making her way out of the room and path into the mining pathways, Diaspro follows the similar sound of metal clinking and clashing, and joins the rest of the party

as part of the plan, Kaimop and Wynn get mining clothes/gear while Diaspro, Thia and Irosys go to Eora’s Bank to withdraw money
Diaspro withdraws enough money to cover the cost of 5 potions
while out and about, each member of the party sends out letters (some thinking it might be for the last time)

The entire kingdom is surrounded by physical and magical walls. The physical walls between cities are thiner and shorter than the outermost walls. This allows for air and ground travel between cities without seeing anything beyond the kingdom. The outermost walls are about thirteen miles (20.9 km) in height, and the inner cities' walls are about 6 miles (9.65 km) in height.
The physical walls seemingly extend infinitely underground, and attempts to find the end in the past has lead to devastating casualties.
All air travel has a maximum altitude before simply being unable to work. The maximum altitude is the height of the outermost walls.
The magical walls are best seen from the sky. A iridescent shimmer can be seen in certain lighting from above as it makes a seemingly dome shape across the kingdom. Magic users and philosophers have hypothesized that the day and night cycle is simulated by the magical barrier. Records show all types of weather patterns to have occurred in the past, but in recent centuries extreme weather changes have come far and few between. Due to the manner in which the kingdom was formed, there has always been a startling lack of a fertile soil. In the beginning, all fertile soil was blessed by Emer and given to the Royal Family to manage. Only this blessed soil has the capacity to grow life.
In modern times, having this soil has been a sign of great wealth or an indication of close ties with the Royal Family. When <a data-href="The Garden" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/landmarks/the-garden.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Garden</a> was being constructed, the Family donated blessed soil to the temple. Over the centuries an enormous tree has grown from it, and has become a symbol of a potential future. <br>Other than the blessed soil, water is the second most regulated resource in Eora. Initially it was also given to the Royal Family to manage, but as Eora grew the Family handed the responsibility to the <a data-href="Council of Eora#Head Councilman of Water" href="2.-world/2.4-government/2.44-council-of-eora/council-of-eora.html#Head Councilman of Water" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Head Councilman of Water</a> and their respective boards.
<br>All water is sourced from the Trench. The Trench is a chasm of groundwater the circles around <a data-href="Hollyhock" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/cities/hollyhock.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hollyhock</a>. The only time the public has access ti the Trench is on Blessings of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Tempest, the Waterbearer" data-href="Tempest, the Waterbearer" href="2.-world/2.6-deities/2.61-the-true-gods/tempest,-the-waterbearer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Waterbearer</a>. On this day (that occurs once every eight years), the Trench is opened in a feat of engineering, and the Waterbearer pours rain only into the chasm. Water is mostly used for hydroponic farming. With the list of crops being reduced to only potatoes, wheat and rice overtime. The crops that remain are only potatoes, wheat and rice. Rice is expensive, and is mostly seen in upper-class districts and cities. Wheat and potatoes are more plentiful and cheap, and are a staple in most dishes. Other produce, spices, condiments, etc. are now chemically manufactured.
Meat and poultry are plentiful and are also a staple in most dishes. Drinkable water is seen as a symbol of wealth, and is expensive to purchase pure. Most people drink milk (or diluted milk), manufactured juices or alcohol. Buildings and structures dating back to the beginning of Eora were made primarily of wood. As the kingdom grew, newer constructions were built from metal and concrete. Similar to drinkable water, having pure wooden fixtures is a sign of wealth and status. ]]></description><link>2.-world/2.8-general/worldbuilding.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">2.

Before and during Basics, families with money can hire private tutors for their children to get ahead. Everyone is required to attend Basics for 10 years before being able to apply to get a higher education. Most kids enroll in Basics between the ages of 5-7. Basics are free, but the quality of the education varies by city. If some children show incredible aptitude, they can be pulled from Basics early and be in internship/mentorship programs. Focuses more on hands-on jobs such as farming, animal handling, metalworking, mechanics, etc.
