<br>a redheaded half-elf and rich-looking wood elf come downstairs from their rooms
<br>the redhead buys a shot at the bar, and the wood elf takes a seat at a table
<br>a mysterious-looking half-elf is whispering to someone at a table under the stairs
<br>the tavern’s newly hired human helper takes a bottle of wine upstairs to room 204

<br>everyone but Cel, the hired helper, the wood elf, and the hooded gnome play

<br>Ava gives the party Rus’ lockerbox and inside was:

<br>picture of current generation of white thal miners
<br>a keycard of Zerin’s
<br>a note with an unusual drawing at the end of it

<br>in order to sneak past the guards to the mines, the party plans to create a explosion that will distract the guards while they slip their way past the gate
<br>while sneaking around, the party notices the upped security due to the recent theft of white thal
<br>after successfully sneaking around the Ivory Guard patrolling the cave entrance, the party uses the symbol found on Rus' letter to navigate the different pathways
<br>while making their way through the mines, the party - minus Diaspro - sinks into loose gravel and fall 60ft into a large cave hub
<br>Thia is the first to notice a large spider along the roof of the hub
<br>the large spider jumps down despite Thia's attempt to make it fall asleep, and the battle begins

 <br>night - Mar 17 (Sat)<br>
<br>the party - minus Diaspro - kill both the large and medium cave spiders. after killing the spiders, the party rushes to pick a burrow opening that could lead out of the den. 
<br>while looking for a way out, Irosys peaks into a burrow opening and sees an opened spider cocoon
<br>soon after choosing an opening, the medium spider that Thia had put to sleep before the battle wakes up and chases them up a narrow crawlspace that leads out of the den
<br>once the party digs their way out, they travel up one of the mining pathways that hasn't been walked in a long time. they go through a series of tunnels before walking on a path that has lanterns hanging from above
<br>eventually the party hears sounds of metal clinking and clashing, and Irosys scouts ahead to investigate 
<br>Irosys stumbles upon a scene of 2 opposing sky pirate factions (<a data-href="Aerosol" href="2.-world/2.7-organizations/2.72-unofficial/aerosol.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Aerosol</a> and <a data-href="The Yuan" href="2.-world/2.7-organizations/2.72-unofficial/the-yuan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Yuan</a>) fighting and arguing. before returning to the group, Irosys overhears the <a data-href="The Yuan" href="2.-world/2.7-organizations/2.72-unofficial/the-yuan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Yuan</a> members wanting someone returned to them. 
<br><br>
<br>after trying to catch anyone from the party as they sink and fall through loose gravel, Diaspro shouts the remaining directions down to them before continuing through the mines
<br>after following the directions, Diaspro makes it to a dead-in as the path ahead looks caved-in. investigating around, Diaspro uncovers a trap door, and uses the rope to travel deeper underground
<br>Diaspro then travels and explores an array of different tunnels before sticking to one that has a metal door in its side. making her way inside, she looks around a locker-room like space before taking a blue-lit lantern, and a black dagger that a skeleton hand was clutching closely 
<br>making her way out of the room and path into the mining pathways, Diaspro follows the similar sound of metal clinking and clashing, and joins the rest of the party

 <br>night - Mar 17 (Sat)<br>
<br>after regrouping with Diaspro, the full party discuss how to get around <a data-href="the Yuan" href="2.-world/2.7-organizations/2.72-unofficial/the-yuan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Yuan</a> and <a data-href="Aerosol" href="2.-world/2.7-organizations/2.72-unofficial/aerosol.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Aerosol</a> fighting
<br>after Irosys does some reconnaissance, the party enacts a plan that distracts and obscures the vision of the sky pirates as the party sneaks past them 
<br>the party fails to sneak past the pirates without being noticed, and Yuan members chase them down a narrow corridor that leads to a chasm with more members
<br>before things could escalate into a full on fight, Disapro talks to one of the higher ranked members until Madam <a data-href="Dolores Lotus" href="3.-npcs/the-yuan/dolores-lotus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dolores Lotus</a> arrives
<br>the Madam and Diaspro have an argument and Diaspro doubles down on the lie as to why she and the rest of party are in the mines
<br>before the Yuan leave, a few things are hinted:

<br>in certain circles, there is a bounty out for people like Irosys
<br>they used an alternative means of leaving the mines, probably by air
<br>the Madam's son is the reason why they were there


<br>the party then traces back Diaspro's steps towards the end of the puzzle they were originally following 
<br>in a small cavity to the side, the party meets a white thal miner named <a data-href="Otto" href="3.-npcs/white-thal-miners/otto.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Otto</a>
<br>takeaways from their conversation with Otto:

<br>Thia reads his mind and relives a meeting between him, Zeke and a mysterious person during a NDA meeting
<br>the only features Thia can pick out is that the mysterious figure has a black band on their left ring finger, an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Esemone, Institute of the Arcana" data-href="Esemone, Institute of the Arcana" href="2.-world/2.5-education/magical-universities/esemone,-institute-of-the-arcana.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Esemone</a> alumni pin on their expensive-looking shirt, and is holding a red crystal
<br>then the party asks Otto why he is alone, and Otto answers vaguely
<br>Irosys reveals his face and asks Otto earnestly if he's seen his dad, Otto denies ever seeing him
<br>Diaspro then offers Otto 10 gold pieces if he answers honestly, but Otto declines saying "It's not what he needs" and that "It's not enough gold anyway"
<br>Otto, in so many words, hints that one of his own is "in trouble" and needs a high-level mage for something
<br>before the party leaves, Kaimop gives Otto the address to <a data-href="the Last Line Tavern" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/landmarks/the-last-line-tavern.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Last Line Tavern</a> and implores him to meet with them tomorrow to talk more about what he needs 


<br>the party then retraces their steps until they make their way out of cave 10

 <br><br>
<br>The entire kingdom is surrounded by physical and magical walls. The physical walls between cities are thiner and shorter than the outermost walls. This allows for air and ground travel between cities without seeing anything beyond the kingdom. The outermost walls are about thirteen miles (20.9 km) in height, and the inner cities' walls are about 6 miles (9.65 km) in height.
<br>The physical walls seemingly extend infinitely underground, and attempts to find the end in the past has lead to devastating casualties.
<br>All air travel has a maximum altitude before simply being unable to work. The maximum altitude is the height of the outermost walls.
<br>The magical walls are best seen from the sky. A iridescent shimmer can be seen in certain lighting from above as it makes a seemingly dome shape across the kingdom. Magic users and philosophers have hypothesized that the day and night cycle is simulated by the magical barrier. Records show all types of weather patterns to have occurred in the past, but in recent centuries extreme weather changes have come far and few between.
<br><br>
<br>Due to the manner in which the kingdom was formed, there has always been a startling lack of a fertile soil. In the beginning, all fertile soil was blessed by Emer and given to the Royal Family to manage. Only this blessed soil has the capacity to grow life.
<br>In modern times, having this soil has been a sign of great wealth or an indication of close ties with the Royal Family. 
<br>When <a data-href="The Garden" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/landmarks/the-garden.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Garden</a> was being constructed, the Family donated blessed soil to the temple. Over the centuries an enormous tree has grown from it, and has become a symbol of a potential future.
<br><br>
<br>Other than the blessed soil, water is the second most regulated resource in Eora. Initially it was also given to the Royal Family to manage, but as Eora grew the Family handed the responsibility to the <a data-href="Council of Eora#Head Councilman of Water" href="2.-world/2.4-government/2.44-council-of-eora/council-of-eora.html#Head_Councilman_of_Water" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Head Councilman of Water</a> and their respective boards.
<br>All water is sourced from the Trench. The Trench is a chasm of groundwater the circles around <a data-href="Hollyhock" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/cities/hollyhock.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hollyhock</a>. The only time the public has access ti the Trench is on Blessings of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Tempest, the Waterbearer" data-href="Tempest, the Waterbearer" href="2.-world/2.6-deities/2.61-the-true-gods/tempest,-the-waterbearer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Waterbearer</a>. On this day (that occurs once every eight years), the Trench is opened in  a feat of engineering, and the Waterbearer pours rain only into the chasm. 
<br>Water is mostly used for hydroponic farming. With the list of crops being reduced to only potatoes, wheat and rice overtime. 
<br><br><br>
<br>The crops that remain are only potatoes, wheat and rice. Rice is expensive, and is mostly seen in upper-class districts and cities. Wheat and potatoes are more plentiful and cheap, and are a staple in most dishes. 
<br>Other produce, spices, condiments, etc. are now chemically manufactured.
<br>Meat and poultry are plentiful and are also a staple in most dishes. 
<br>Drinkable water is seen as a symbol of wealth, and is expensive to purchase pure. Most people drink milk (or diluted milk), manufactured juices or alcohol.
<br><br>
<br>Buildings and structures dating back to the beginning of Eora were made primarily of wood. As the kingdom grew, newer constructions were built from metal and concrete. Similar to drinkable water, having pure wooden fixtures is a sign of wealth and status.

<br>The building itself is elevated, with a small staircase leading to the front entrance. On either side of the staircase are large white columns that go from ceiling to floor. 
<br><br>
<br>The front area consists of a lobby that showcases exhibits of older mechanisms native to <a data-href="Anemone" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/cities/anemone.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anemone</a>. The mechanisms are mining tool and manufacturing technologies. The front area also consists of a front desk.
<br>The back section of the temple is the main area. It consists of parallel pews all facing an artsy clock on an intricately designed podium. On either side of the podium are stairs that lead to the second floor.
<br>The second floor has three doors leading to offices to the western side. The northern side has a door leading to the temple's library. The eastern side has a door leading to a small storage room. From the second floor, the entirety of the first floor can be seen. 
<br><br>
<br>A single-story room with shelves of books lining almost every wall. In the center is a cluster of tables, and pressed against the western wall is a couch. Most books only date back a couple of centuries, and the few that don't consist of common texts.

Her immaterial forms include rumbling earth, crunched leaves, and sounds of nature.<br>Emer’s symbol is of a rose, although any plant imagery can be attributed to her.<br>Historians believe her to be the oldest of the True Gods, and they read about her maturity and wisdom in solving conflicts of long past. Emer is viewed as a gentle and maternal-like figure, although in recent centuries her influence has started to become overshadowed by her fellow gods. <br><br>Emer is the goddess of soil, creatures and remembrance. Her followers are often found in roles relating to preservation. Famous historians, record-keepers, and scribes are known to be devout believers. Farmers are also known to ask for her blessing over crops and animals. <br><br>Over six thousand years ago, the Shadow Flood swept across the lands and consumed everything in its path. To protect those remaining, the 3 True Gods created the Kingdom of Eora as a haven. Vulcan the Inventor, created the kingdom's foundations using his omnipotent knowledge of technology.

Emer of the Soil gave the kingdom life giving it a precious amount of soil, crops, and animals.&nbsp;<br>Soon after establishing the Kingdom of Eora, the True Gods hand-picked and blessed a Dark Elven family (the Pacifics) that would become the Royal Family. The Waterbearer then chose the First Queen of Eora, and the line of succession has run through women ever since. Once the surviving populace was safe within Eora’s walls, the True Gods spent and continued to spend their time battling against the Shadow Flood.

Rumors have it that the original leader of the guild was blessed by the Inventor with the gift of an innate understanding of mechanics/technology. The Guild can almost be seen as a government body but is more like a bureaucracy. The Guild has a hand in most avenues that rely heavily on mechanics (aka transportation, manufacturing/mining, research/innovation

Those of the Branches are most commonly seen with the Royal Family and others of high status/wealth.&nbsp; Those of the Lower Roots are well-respected in the general public but are overshadowed within the Woodland Clan. The main family of the Branches was (rumored to be) second place when the Royal Family was originally chosen.

<br>the remaining party , either invisible or in mist form, sneak on the next train that takes them out of <a data-href="the Mining Circle" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/the-circles/the-mining-circle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Mining Circle</a>

<br>while sleeping, Wynn is visited by her patron. through them, Wynn sees a potential future that details fissures running along the magical barrier that surrounds the kingdom. this future is seen as the best outcome


<br><br>
<br>after getting caught by the Ivory Guards stationed outside the western entrance of the mines, Diaspro is taken into custody by one of the guards named Thane
<br>Thane is tasked with taking her to one of the Guard bases in Anemone to be processed for trespassing on private property and forgery of an official document
<br>after getting off the train it's quickly revealed that Thane has no idea where he's going. Diaspro takes this opportunity to take charge and lead them towards the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="a satellite temple of The Inventor" data-href="a satellite temple of The Inventor" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/landmarks/a-satellite-temple-of-the-inventor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Akkins branch</a> of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vulcan, the Inventor" data-href="Vulcan, the Inventor" href="2.-world/2.6-deities/2.61-the-true-gods/vulcan,-the-inventor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Inventor</a> instead
<br>once they arrive, Diaspro has <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="a satellite temple of The Inventor > ^Symon" data-href="a satellite temple of The Inventor#^Symon" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/landmarks/a-satellite-temple-of-the-inventor.html#^Symon" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reverend Symon</a> send an expedited letter to her father asking for a legal aid
<br>Diaspro then refuses to be moved from this location, forcing Thane to call in the local AoP that will arrive the next morning. before going to sleep, Diaspro takes another look through the temple's small library:

<br>she finds a book that talks about a cult that had played a role in <a data-href="the Scorched Petals" href="2.-world/2.2-history/events/the-scorched-petals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Scorched Petals</a> that was stationed somewhere in the mines 


<br>while sleeping, Diaspro has a dream reliving a memory. in the dream, Diaspro embodies someone who standing before a shimmering crack floating above an alter. the dream abruptly cuts off as that someone takes the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="black dagger.jpg" data-href="black dagger.jpg" href="4.-extra/pictures/black-dagger.jpg" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">black dagger</a> in their hands and brings it up to their chest
<br>day - Mar 18 (Sun)<br>
<br>early in the morning the AoP arrive, but Diaspro hides from them until Margret arrives.
